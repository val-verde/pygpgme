pygpgme-0.3: 2012-03-08

 * Add support for Python 3 (tested with Python 3.2).  Data being
   encrypted, decrypted, signed or verified is treated as bytes, while
   textual data (including textual representations of binary data like
   key IDs) uses the string/unicode type.
 * The test suite has been moved to the toplevel and is no longer
   installed with the extension.
 * The examples directory is now included in tarball releases.

pygpgme-0.2: 2011-08-17

 * Update the code base to work with newer versions of GPGME
 * Update extension code to make it easier to port to Python 3 (this
   version still doesn't support Python 3). In general, this involves
   making sure we return Unicode strings for textual data and byte
   strings for binary data.
 * Add support for the genkey API.
 * Add support for symmetric encryption in encrypt().

pygpgme-0.1: 2006-03-27

 * Initial Release.
